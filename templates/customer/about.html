                    <b>Food, shelter, and clothing</b> are the three major requisites for life. But it is disheartening to know that one in every eight persons in the world does not have adequate clothing. Then there is the prevalent problem of discarding old and worn out clothes. Recent studies have revealed that there is a huge number of people who discard their clothes each season while not reusing them or donating them.
                    This is why Enactus IIT Ropar is working hard to address this issue through its initiative Vatsra. The project has left no stone unturned, from collaborating with numerous colleges to organizing countless cloth distribution camps, Vastra has done it all. 
                    Vastra essentially collects old clothes from various sources and gives them to an entrepreneur. The entrepreneur stores the clothes in a warehouse and segregates them in various categories depending on their condition. The clothes in bad condition are recycled and turned into high-quality carpets and blankets, wheres the other ones are washed and re-sold at low rates in various camps.
                    Till now we have impacted thousands of lives, be it the entrepreneurs working for us, the people who wash and recycle the clothes, people working in the mills making carpets and the poor people who ultimately wear the clothes. It is now that Vastra has been active for almost 3 years that we are realizing the dream of Vastra, and are able to see the entire process working smoothly. 
                    Yes, it took a lot of groundwork, innumerable field trips and plenty of sleepless nights, but now that the path is set, the progress of the project can be seen and the business created by team Vastra can be remarked upon.
